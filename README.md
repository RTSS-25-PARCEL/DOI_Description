## Overview

This repository serves as a central entry point to the **PARCEL framework** and its accompanying supplemental materials.

* The **PARCEL framework** can be accessed at: [https://github.com/RTSS-25-PARCEL/Parcel](https://github.com/SEG-DENSE/Parcel).
  This repository contains the full implementation of PARCEL, including source code, build instructions, and usage examples.
  This repository provides additional artifacts such as benchmarks, experimental data, case studies, and evaluation scripts that support the results presented in our work.

* The **supplemental materials** are available at the folder _supplemental_material_.

Together, these resources provide the complete environment necessary to reproduce, evaluate, and extend the PARCEL framework.
